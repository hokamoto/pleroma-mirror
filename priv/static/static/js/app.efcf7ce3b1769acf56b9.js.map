So the only thing an admin needs to\n      do to style Pleroma is to change these colors in that one css file.\n      Some default things (body text color, link color) need to be set dy-\n      namically, so this is done here by waiting for the stylesheet to be\n      loaded and then creating an element with the respective classes.\n\n      It is a bit weird, but should make life for admins
