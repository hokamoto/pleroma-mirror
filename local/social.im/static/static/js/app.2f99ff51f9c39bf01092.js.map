To have\n      a good set of default themes, I chose the system from base16\n      (https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/) to style all elements. They\n      all have the base00..0F classes. So the only thing an admin needs to\n      do to style Pleroma is to change these colors in that one css file.\n      Some default things (body text color, link color) need to be set dy-\n      namically, so this is done here by waiting for the stylesheet to be\n      loaded and then creating an element with the respective classes.\n\n      It is a bit weird, but should make life for admins somewhat easier.\n  ***/\n  const head = document.head\n  const body = document.body\n  body.style.display = 'none'\n  const cssEl = document.createElement('link')\n  cssEl.setAttribute('rel', 'stylesheet')\n  cssEl.setAttribute('href', href)\n  head.appendChild(cssEl)\n\n  const setDynamic = () => {\n    const baseEl = document.createElement('div')\n    body.appendChild(baseEl)\n\n    let colors = {}\n    times(16, (n) => {\n      const name = `base0${n.toString(16).toUpperCase()}`\n      baseEl.setAttribute('class', name)\n      const color = window.getComputedStyle(baseEl).getPropertyValue('color')\n      colors[name] = color\n    })\n\n    body.removeChild(baseEl)\n\n    const styleEl = document.createElement('style')\n    head.appendChild(styleEl)\n    // const styleSheet = styleEl.sheet\n\n    body.style.display = 'initial'\n  }\n\n  cssEl.addEventListener('load', setDynamic)\n}\n\nconst rgb2rgba = function (rgba) {\n  return `rgba(${rgba.r}, ${rgba.g}, ${rgba.b}, ${rgba.a})`\n}\n\nconst getTextColor = function (bg, text, preserve) {\n  const bgIsLight = convert(bg).hsl.l > 50\n  const textIsLight = convert(text).hsl.l > 50\n\n  if ((bgIsLight && textIsLight) || (!bgIsLight && !textIsLight)) {\n    const base = typeof text.a !== 'undefined' ? { a: text.a } : {}\n    const result = Object.assign(base, invertLightness(text).rgb)\n    if (!preserve && getContrastRatio(bg, result) < 4.5) {\n      return contrastRatio(bg, text).rgb\n    }\n    return result\n  }\n  return text\n}\n\nconst applyTheme = (input, commit) => {\n  const { rules, theme } = generatePreset(input)\n  const head = document.head\n  const body = document.body\n  body.style.display = 'none'\n\n  const styleEl = document.createElement('style')\n  head.appendChild(styleEl)\n  const styleSheet = styleEl.sheet\n\n  styleSheet.toString()\n  styleSheet.insertRule(`body { ${rules.radii} }`, 'index-max')\n  styleSheet.insertRule(`body { ${rules.colors} }`, 'index-max')\n  styleSheet.insertRule(`body { ${rules.shadows} }`, 'index-max')\n  styleSheet.insertRule(`body { ${rules.fonts} }`, 'index-max')\n  body.style.display = 'initial'\n\n  // commit('setOption', { name: 'colors', value: htmlColors })\n  // commit('setOption', { name: 'radii', value: radii })\n  commit('setOption', { name: 'customTheme', value: input })\n  commit('setOption', { name: 'colors', value: theme.colors })\n}\n\nconst getCssShadow = (input, usesDropShadow) => {\n  if (input.length === 0) {\n    return 'none'\n  }\n\n  return input\n    .filter(_ => usesDropShadow ? _.inset : _)\n    .map((shad) => [\n      shad.x,\n      shad.y,\n      shad.blur,\n      shad.spread\n    ].map(_ => _ + 'px').concat([\n      getCssColor(shad.color, shad.alpha),\n      shad.inset ?
